During Class time - 10:15:

I already create the project and comment the port line to run it and it is working right.

I created a repo in github but I cant see it. 

I modifyed the startup and it is working

10:42 Im trying to apply a bootstap style but is not working really well.

11:07 After looking around for the reason of why the bootstrap wasnt working and a short break, I figured it out what was heppening. Basically the href link wasnt the correct one for the new bootstrap file I picked.

11:11 Now I find another issue, I dont know which theme should I select. For that reason I added my two favorite themes. And I can change the theme whenever I want.

11:23 Im adding the new stylesheet and script links in the Layout.cshtml file.

11:35 Now lets add the dropdown to the nav bar.

11:46 I add the dropdown menu but it is not working

Date: 10/26/2023

18:06 I have been trying to fix the dropdown but I havent been able to do it.

18:39 Finally I solved the issue with the dropdown.

Date: 10/30/2023

7:36 Last Time I solved the issue with the Drpdown I just went to the boostrap documentation and I had missing some stuff. So Ill create the 3 new projects.

8:06 So I have finished but it is really wierd because I have no errors but I cant run the project so I will copy the redme and start all over again.

9:34 I have tryed with different versions (3.1, 5.0) and still not working and I have to do something so Im going to copy the readme and I ll try something else later. This sucks :(

12:39 I just got to the lab again lets see how it goes.

1:49 It is not going really well, I follow every single step but I cant run the project. But I have to go to class.

3:01 Again, I have no errors but it doesnt run because I have an error.

3:03 after running it. An error pop out, I tryed to solve it and I could run it but it says "MissingMethodException" and I dont know what to do.

3:06 Maybe its me and I just need to let it go.

3:12 This is like the 10th time I have tryed this. I dont know hy did I choose this course.

8:49 I have been working in this assignment since 7:30 and I thought that I have lost my readme but it was in an other computer. Basically I started from the beginning with the help of the GOAT(Christian) and I could crete the projects but I know the pushes to github wasnt working because we are creting the new projects outside of the folder.So I decided to do it again but inside of the project to solve this issue.

9:18 I decided to crete a new project so I dont have problems pushing it to github.

4:23 I finally could run the project. My mistake was the versions I was using so Used other versions and thats it. Intead of 5.0.11 I used 5.0.17.  :) :P

4:24 Lets continue doing building the project.

4:45 I almost mess the project up because I replace this {controller=Home} with this {area=Customer}

4:52 Im getting thsi error InvalidOperationException: The layout view '~/Views/Shared/_Layout' could not be located. The following locations were searched: ~/Views/Shared/_Layout
Obviously it is not finding the file, Ill figure it out.

4:53 I t was just the missing . cshtml Im feeling so dumb. :') :P

5:03 I can run the project but my buttons are not working and there is no log in and resgister buttons.

5:18 I found out why my buttons wasnt working and appering, it was because I moved them from views>shared to the customer area instead of copy and pasting it. Eventhough I found the problem, Chritian gives me the magic.

5:25 Modifying the database in the appsettings.json ((aspnet-)NicolasBookStore(-61B15D62-E9A3-472E-9480-03636B2E4A43))

5:40 Im about to add the migrations with this command "add-migrations addDefaultIdentityMigration"

5:45 Im not risking it so this is the name 20231101214237_addDefaultIdentityMigration

6:14 For now, there have been no issues. WELLL... Just a misspelling mistake with the MaxLength as MaxLenght
